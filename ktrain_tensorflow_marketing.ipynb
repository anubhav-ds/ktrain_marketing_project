    "Theragun produces various kind of Health and Wellness products and they have hired us to help in their recent Online marketing campaign. They are interested in placing their ads via Google Adsense and other platforms specifically on the Articles cenetered around Health and related Wellness topics. Their goal is to identify as many such articles as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "To fulfil this need we have created a Deep Learning Model based on pretrained DistilBERT model availaible via K-Train wrapper in Tensorflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> Note: While the course required the work in Google Colab, due to Colab restrictions GPU was not availaible for more than 2 days in free mode as even the checking of learning rate exhausted the free quota, and since dedicated Nvidia GPUs were availaible model was trained on an 8 GB RTX 4060 Mobile GPU with 135 Watt Power limit. This fact should be considered if work here is reproduced as it will effect the time taken for all the process and most importantly smaller batch sizes to run on 8 GB VRAM. <b>"

However first and second articles are definitely not based on these topics.\n",

    "1. New model with more negative observations was able to successfully avoid flagging first one as healthy/wellness with probability of 0.418 against  0.67 from previous model. This reflects that in some cases new models trained on more negative examples could help us.\n",
    "2. Both models are still mostly focused on few keywords like Health, mental health, and more. Due to this even if Second model was able to identify first article properly it failed in second article.\n",
    "3. Still, new model is able to learn more complex representations. Both first and last article has difference more than 0.2 in predicting healthy/wellness articles, while first was definitely is not such an article, last one is about the Wellness Industry and generally is not catering to the target audience of Theragun as it was posted on a Financial Website.\n",

    "Overall, model with more negative example seems to have learned more complex representaations across different words even if we have lower recall for the Positive Examples. We cam improve the model further with more training data, more positive data while keeping current propertion of 2:1 or opting for 3:1, higher propertion for Negative examples and lesser for the positive examples. We can also try more complex models on more powerful computing resources."
